Lamborghini Urus SE Website

A front-end project I built for QAP1 as part of my Front-End Development course. This is a multi-page website inspired by the 2025 Lamborghini Urus SE, built from scratch using HTML and CSS.
The goal was to practice structuring and styling a full website without using pre-made templates.
